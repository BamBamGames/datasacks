Notes for updating other projects using the Datasacks past
commit 2be80bc252 (June 9, 2019 and onwards):

- make your project "clean" in source control (no modified files)

- open Unity in your project

- move all of your project datasacks OUT of the root Datasack folder:

	Move any Datasacks you find here:
	~/Assets/Datasack
	~/Assets/Datasack/Resources/Datasacks

	Move them elsewhere in your project, but right now under
	a Resources/Datasacks directory structure as before.

- hit CodeGen on any Datasack and commit all changes, including
	any fixup of inadvertently-changed folder names.

- close Unity in your project

- delete the ENTIRE ~/Assets/Datasack directory in your project.

- copy over the ENTIRE ~/Assets/Datasack directory from the Datasacks repo

- open Unity in your project (you will likely have a slew of errors)

- hit CodeGen on any Datasack and commit all changes

- Your project should be 100% functional now. Please test. If there
	are problems, revert to the above source commit and retry

- If you have a very old version of Datasacks, you might need to
	transiently create a static Datasack named UserIntent somewhere
	in the DSM class to get the new code to compile:

	public static Datasack UserIntent;

	Then after you get it to compile and codegen, you will have a
	duplicate UserIntent identifier, so delete your temp code.

- test and commit all changes
