Notes for updating other projects using the Datasacks past
commit 2be80bc252 (June 9, 2019 and onwards):

- make your project "clean" in source control (no modified files)

- open Unity in your project

- move all of your project datasacks OUT of the Datasacks folder:

	Move any Datasacks you find here:
	~/Assets/Datasack/Resources/Datasacks

- hit CodeGen on any Datasack and commit all changes

- close Unity in your project

- delete the ENTIRE ~/Assets/Datasack directory in your project.

- copy the ENTIRE ~/Assets/Datasack directory from the datasacks repo

- open Unity in your project (you will likely have a slew of errors)

- hit CodeGen on any Datasack and commit all changes

- Your project should be 100% functional now. Please test. If there
	are problems, revert to the above source commit and retry

- commit all changes
